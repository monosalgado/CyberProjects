## Projects Overview
1. SQL Injection Attack:
A controlled environment project simulating an SQL injection attack on a web application (seed-server) using Docker and MySQL. This project demonstrates:
- Exploiting web application vulnerabilities
- Bypassing authentication mechanisms
- Extracting sensitive database information
- Implementing security testing techniques in a sandboxed setup

2. Buffer Overflow Attack:
A controlled lab environment project showcasing a buffer overflow attack using:
- Exploiting unchecked `strcpy()` function vulnerabilities
- Injecting shellcode to overwrite return address
- Establishing root access through memory manipulation
- Demonstrating remote code execution techniques in a sandboxed setup

3. Network Traffic Analysis Project
Comprehensive network traffic analysis using Wireshark, demonstrating:
- Packet filtering by protocol (HTTP, TCP)
- IP and port-specific traffic examination
- Protocol hierarchy and communication statistics
- Endpoint traffic analysis techniques

4. Intrusion Detection System Setup
Snort-based IDS/IPS project showcasing:
- Configuring network-specific detection rules
- Implementing intrusion detection mechanisms
- Log analysis and threat monitoring techniques
  
5. Network Security Firewall Configuration
Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) project highlighting:
- Network access control configuration
- Port and IP-based traffic management
- Advanced firewall rule implementation
- Security policy enforcement techniques

6. Web Application Security Testing with OWASP ZAP
A web security assessment project using OWASP ZAP to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in a Flask-based web application. This project demonstrates:
- Configuring OWASP ZAP as a proxy for automated security testing
- Performing active and passive scans to detect vulnerabilities
- Identifying SQL injection risks in user input handling
- Implementing secure coding practices to prevent exploitation
