# Cybersecurity CTF & HTB Training Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity write-ups repository! This collection documents my hands-on learning journey through university CTF challenges and Hack The Box Academy modules, completed as part of my **Capture The Flag (CTF) course** at the **University of South Florida**.

## üß† Purpose

This repository serves as a portfolio of practical skills developed in **offensive cybersecurity**, covering real-world attack vectors such as:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Session Hijacking & Fixation
- Local & Remote File Inclusion
- Web Shell Deployment
- Brute Forcing Techniques
- Network Traffic Analysis

### üéØ CTF Challenge Write-ups

- [BlindPDF](./WriteUp_BlindPDF.pdf): Exploiting HTML-to-PDF conversion with JavaScript and local file access
- [Dancing Files](./WriteUp_DancingFiles.pdf): Wireshark-based credential interception and file server access
- [PawForce](./WriteUp_PawForce.pdf): SQLite-based SQL Injection in URL parameters
- [CTFFinal](./CTFFinal.pdf): Final comprehensive practical exercise

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Used

- **Web Exploitation**: XSS, SQLi, LFI/RFI, Session Exploits
- **Network Analysis**: Wireshark, Packet Dissection
- **Burp Suite**: Interception, Parameter Tampering
- **MySQL & SQLite**: Database Enumeration & Union Exploits
- **XSStrike & Netcat**: Payload Crafting and Listener Setup
- **HTML/JavaScript**: Web Payloads, Form Injection, JS Fetch/Requests
- **Shells**: PHP Web Shells, Command Execution

## üè´ Academic Context

These exercises were completed as part of the **Capture The Flag course** at USF, where I applied cybersecurity theory in offensive simulations and learned to:

- Discover and exploit web application flaws
- Capture session tokens and elevate privileges
- Build and document attack chains using professional tools
- Think critically about **defensive mitigations** and ethical hacking principles

## üìå Key Takeaways

- Exploiting vulnerabilities is just half the battle; **risk mitigation strategies** are documented for each challenge.
- These challenges emphasize the importance of **secure development practices**, proper session management, and the consequences of insecure coding.
